          My academic journey is rooted in a fascination with how technology can
          solve real-world problems and improve everyday life. This fascination
          has led me to immerse myself in various aspects of computer science,
          from software development and artificial intelligence to cybersecurity
          and data science.

          Nowadays, I'm a Artificial Intelligence and Data Science major at the
          Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. I have been dabbling in
          front-end and back-end web development when I have time off studying.
          It's a lot of fun, and I'm always looking for new projects to work on
          when I have the time... (never)

          Ultimately, I want to create websites that I could see myself using
          every day.
